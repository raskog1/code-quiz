# Code Quiz

## Description

The assignment was to create a timed coding quiz that would generate a final score at the end, and add it to a leaderboard. In my quiz, the user is given 100 seconds to complete 10 questions pertaining to HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. Answering wrong, penalizes the user's total score, and deducts time from the clock. Answering correctly, calculates a score based on how much time it took the user to answer. The leaderboard displays the top 8 scores.
